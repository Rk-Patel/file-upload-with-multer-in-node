# file-upload-with-multer-in-node
File Upload in Node.js using Multer is an important feature for any web application. Multer is a Node.js or express middleware, that makes it easy to handle multipart/form-data when your users upload files. When a website user uploads a file to a server, it is usually submitted via a form and encoded as multipart/form-data.
